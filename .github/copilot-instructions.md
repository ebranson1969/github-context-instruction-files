## Coding Style Preferences

### General Principles
- Write clean, readable, and maintainable code
- Use descriptive variable and function names
- Include meaningful comments for complex logic
- Follow DRY (Don't Repeat Yourself) principles
- Prefer explicit over implicit code

### Python Standards
- Follow PEP 8 style guidelines
- Use type hints where appropriate
- Include docstrings for functions and classes
- Use meaningful variable names (avoid single letters except for loops)
- Prefer list/dict comprehensions for simple operations

### Documentation Standards
- Use Markdown for all documentation files
- Include code examples in documentation
- Maintain consistent formatting and structure
- Keep README files up to date
- Document all public APIs and functions

## Framework-Specific Patterns

### File Organization
- Group related functionality in dedicated directories
- Use clear, descriptive file names
- Maintain consistent directory structure
- Separate configuration from implementation

### Error Handling
- Use appropriate exception types
- Include meaningful error messages
- Log errors appropriately
- Handle edge cases gracefully

## Libraries and Dependencies

### Preferred Libraries
- Use standard library when possible
- Choose well-maintained, popular libraries
- Document all external dependencies
- Keep dependencies up to date

### Code Patterns to Follow
- Use context managers for resource management
- Implement proper logging instead of print statements
- Follow single responsibility principle
- Use appropriate data structures for the task

## Code Patterns to Avoid
- Avoid global variables when possible
- Don't use bare except clauses
- Avoid deep nesting (prefer early returns)
- Don't ignore error conditions
- Avoid magic numbers and strings

## Project-Specific Naming Conventions

### Files and Directories
- Use lowercase with hyphens for directory names
- Use lowercase with underscores for Python files
- Use descriptive names that indicate purpose
- Group related files in appropriate directories

### Variables and Functions
- Use snake_case for Python variables and functions
- Use UPPER_CASE for constants
- Use descriptive names that explain purpose
- Prefix private methods/variables with underscore

## Architecture Patterns to Maintain

### Modular Design
- Separate concerns into different modules
- Use clear interfaces between components
- Keep modules loosely coupled
- Design for testability and maintainability

### Documentation Structure
- Maintain guides in documents/guides/
- Keep context files in .github/ structure
- Use consistent formatting across all docs
- Include examples and practical guidance
