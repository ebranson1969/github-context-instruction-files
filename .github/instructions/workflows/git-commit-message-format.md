# Git Commit Message Formatting Workflow
*Standardized commit message format and content for consistency and traceability*

## Commit Message Format Standards
*Establishes consistent format for all automated commits*
- Use descriptive commit messages when possible
- For automatic commits, use the format: "Auto-commit: [brief description of changes]"
- Include relevant file names or feature descriptions when appropriate
- Maintain consistency in messaging style across all automated operations

## Content Guidelines
*Defines what information should be included in commit messages*
- Brief but descriptive summary of changes made
- Reference to the type of operation performed (creation, update, deletion)
- Context about why changes were made when relevant
- File or feature names that were modified

## Integration with Other Workflows
*Ensures compatibility with existing git operation workflows*
- Used by Automatic Git Operations Workflow for session-end commits
- Applied by Manual Git Trigger Workflow for user-initiated commits
- Integrated with Manual Context Sync Workflow for project restructuring commits
- Maintains traceability across all git operations

## Status
**ACTIVE** - Ensures consistent and meaningful commit messages across all automated git operations. Required for maintaining clear project history and audit trail.
