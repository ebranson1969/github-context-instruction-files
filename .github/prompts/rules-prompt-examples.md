# Rules Creation Prompt - Examples and Documentation

*Comprehensive guide to understanding and using the unified rules creation prompt template*

## File Purpose
This file provides detailed explanations, usage instructions, and multiple examples for the rules creation prompt template located in `rules-prompt.md`. Use this guide to understand how to properly fill out and use the template.

---

## ðŸš¨ CRITICAL: Session Logging Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)
All rule creation activities must be properly logged according to established protocols. These requirements are MANDATORY for every rule creation request.

**Key Requirements:**
- Session logging must be active before starting any rule creation
- All research, reasoning, and file modifications must be documented
- The exact prompt used in chat must be logged
- Git commits must be tracked and logged
- No rule implementation is considered complete without proper logging

---

## Template Structure Explanation

### Section 1: Your Question/Request
**Purpose**: Establishes the context and ensures session logging is activated
- Always starts with "I need you to create a new rule file in the modular instruction system"
- Includes mandatory session logging reminder
- Sets expectation for comprehensive documentation

### Section 2: Rule Information
**Purpose**: Defines the basic metadata and structure for the rule

**Rule Name**: The formal name of the rule (e.g., "Session Context Preservation Rule")
**Rule Description**: A concise explanation of what the rule establishes or controls
**File Location**: The exact path where the rule file will be created (always follows pattern: `.github/instructions/rules/[kebab-case-name]-rule.md`)

### Section 3: Protocol Sections Needed
**Purpose**: Defines the main organizational sections within the rule file
- Each protocol section represents a major area of control or functionality
- Include a brief description for each section
- These become the main headings (##) in the rule file

### Section 4: Specific Requirements
**Purpose**: Lists the detailed requirements and bullet points for each protocol section
- These become the actual implementation details
- Should be actionable and specific
- Will be organized under the appropriate protocol sections

### Section 5: Rule Status (ACTIVE/NOT ACTIVE)
**Purpose**: Determines whether the rule gets a reference link in the main copilot-instructions.md file

**ACTIVE (Default)**: Creates both the rule file AND adds a reference link to copilot-instructions.md
- Requires additional information for the reference link
- Most common choice for production rules

**NOT ACTIVE**: Creates only the rule file without a reference link
- Used for draft rules or rules not yet ready for production
- Can be activated later by manually adding the reference link

### Section 6: If ACTIVE Additional Information
**Purpose**: Provides the metadata needed to create the reference link

**Priority Description**: The urgency/importance level (usually in ALL CAPS)
**Reference Description**: The text that appears in the link description
**Location**: Whether it goes in CRITICAL RULES SECTION or GENERAL RULES SECTION

### Section 7: Reference Link Format
**Purpose**: Shows exactly how the link will appear in copilot-instructions.md
- Uses ðŸ”´ emoji for critical rules
- Includes the priority description and link to the rule file

### Section 8: Rule File Structure
**Purpose**: Provides the template structure for the actual rule file
- Shows how the protocol sections and requirements will be organized
- Includes the Status section at the bottom with checkbox format

### Section 9: Session Logging Protocol
**Purpose**: Confirms that the session will be logged (almost always YES)

### Section 10: PUSH CODE Protocol
**Purpose**: Determines if changes should be automatically pushed to git (almost always YES)

### Section 11: Additional Context
**Purpose**: Provides specific logging requirements and traceability information

### Section 12: Expected Deliverables
**Purpose**: Clearly states what files will be created and what actions will be taken

## Usage Instructions

1. **Ensure Session Logging is Active** - Verify you're in a logged session
2. **Copy the entire template** from `rules-prompt.md`
3. **Replace all `[INSERT...]` placeholders** with your specific information
4. **Choose ACTIVE or NOT ACTIVE** (ACTIVE is pre-selected)
5. **If ACTIVE, fill in the reference link information**
6. **Use kebab-case for filenames** (e.g., `my-new-rule-name-rule.md`)
7. **Paste the completed prompt into chat**

## Common Patterns and Best Practices

### Rule Naming Conventions
- Use descriptive, clear names that indicate the rule's purpose
- End all rule names with "Rule" for consistency
- Use title case (e.g., "Security Validation Rule", not "security validation rule")

### File Naming Conventions
- Use kebab-case for filenames (lowercase with hyphens)
- Always end with "-rule.md"
- Examples: `security-validation-rule.md`, `documentation-standards-rule.md`

### Protocol Section Organization
- Organize sections logically from general to specific
- Use parallel structure in section names
- Include 2-4 main protocol sections per rule for optimal organization

### Requirement Writing Guidelines
- Write requirements as actionable statements
- Include specific metrics and timeframes where applicable
- Use "must" for mandatory requirements, "should" for recommendations
- Be specific about who is responsible for each requirement

### ACTIVE vs NOT ACTIVE Decision Guide
- Choose **ACTIVE** for rules that are ready for immediate implementation
- Choose **NOT ACTIVE** for draft rules, experimental policies, or rules pending approval
- Most production rules should be ACTIVE to ensure visibility in the main instructions

### Reference Link Placement Guide
- **CRITICAL RULES SECTION**: Security, data protection, legal compliance, system stability
- **GENERAL RULES SECTION**: Documentation, coding standards, workflow processes, team collaboration

This comprehensive guide provides everything needed to understand and effectively use the rules creation prompt template for any type of organizational rule or protocol.
