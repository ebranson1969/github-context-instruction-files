# Rules Creation Prompts

*Project prompts for creating and managing rules in the copilot system*

**üö® CRITICAL: Session Logging Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
All rule creation activities must be properly logged according to the Session Context Preservation Rule and Question Processing Rule. The requirements in this section are MANDATORY and must be followed for every rule prompt and implementation.

**Session Logging Protocol Enforcement:**
- Session logging MUST be the first and last action for every user request, regardless of the task.
- Session logging is a gating requirement: no other actions (file edits, commits, etc.) may be performed until the session log is updated.
- The agent MUST verify the session log after every user interaction and before ending its turn, ensuring no step is missed.
- The session must be logged in the appropriate project directory.
- All research, reasoning, and file modifications must be documented.
- Git commits must be tracked and logged to maintain audit trail.
- Session logging continues throughout the rule implementation process.
- **The exact prompt used in chat must be logged in the session log.**
- **The prompt file location (.github/prompts/rules-prompt.md) must be documented.**
- **No rule implementation is considered complete unless these logging requirements are fully met**

## Prompt 2: Add Rule and Reference Link

### Prompt Template
```
I need you to create a complete rule implementation with both the rule definition and reference link.

**CRITICAL**: This session must be properly logged according to established protocols. Document all research, reasoning, and file modifications throughout this comprehensive rule implementation process.

Step 1: Add the rule to copilot-rules.md using Template 2 from .github/copilot-templates.md
Step 2: Add the reference link to copilot-instructions.md using Template 1 from .github/copilot-templates.md

Rule Information:
- Rule Name: [INSERT RULE NAME HERE]
- Rule Description: [INSERT WHAT THIS RULE ESTABLISHES OR CONTROLS]
- Priority Description: [INSERT PRIORITY DESCRIPTION IN UPPERCASE]
- Reference Description: [INSERT DESCRIPTION FOR THE LINK TEXT]

Protocol Sections:
- [INSERT PROTOCOL/SECTION NAME 1]: [INSERT BRIEF DESCRIPTION]
  - [INSERT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]
- [INSERT PROTOCOL/SECTION NAME 2]: [INSERT BRIEF DESCRIPTION]  
  - [INSERT SPECIFIC REQUIREMENTS]

Location in copilot-instructions.md: [INSERT WHERE TO ADD THE REFERENCE LINK]

Session Logging Requirements:
- Log this complete rule implementation in the current session log
- Document research and reasoning for both rule design and reference placement
- Track file modifications to both copilot-rules.md and copilot-instructions.md
- Log git commit message when changes are pushed
- Document the relationship between the rule and existing protocols
- **Log the complete prompt used in chat (copy the entire prompt from chat)**
- **Document prompt source: .github/prompts/rules-prompt.md - Prompt 2**

Please create both the rule and the reference link, keeping the rule status as NOT ACTIVE until implementation is complete. Ensure comprehensive session logging throughout this multi-file implementation process.
```

### Example Usage - Using Session Context Preservation Rule
```
I need you to create a complete rule implementation with both the rule definition and reference link.

**CRITICAL**: This session must be properly logged according to established protocols. Document all research, reasoning, and file modifications throughout this comprehensive rule implementation process.

Step 1: Add the rule to copilot-rules.md using Template 2 from .github/copilot-templates.md
Step 2: Add the reference link to copilot-instructions.md using Template 1 from .github/copilot-templates.md

Rule Information:
- Rule Name: Session Context Preservation Rule
- Rule Description: Establishes critical session management protocols that MUST be maintained across all interactions
- Priority Description: HIGHEST PRIORITY - PRESERVE THIS CONTEXT ACROSS ALL SESSIONS
- Reference Description: Session Context Preservation Rules

Protocol Sections:
- Mandatory Session Logging: Ensures all agent interactions are properly documented and preserved for future reference
  - All agent interactions must be logged in dedicated project directories
  - Session logs must capture: original questions, research reasoning, actions taken, file modifications, git commits
  - Logging format must include timestamps, question numbers, and detailed change summaries
- Session Continuity: Maintains connection between sessions and preserves project context across interactions
  - Each logged session must maintain connection to previous sessions through cross-references
  - Project context must be preserved across session restarts
  - Session logs must be updated throughout the interaction, not just at the end
- Context Failure Recovery: Provides recovery mechanism when AI context degrades due to token limitations
  - If session context appears degraded, immediately reference session logs to restore project understanding
  - Session logs act as backup context when AI token limits cause instruction degradation
  - All critical protocols must be re-established from session logs when context fails

Location in copilot-instructions.md: CRITICAL RULES SECTION

2. Copy the prompt template
3. Replace all `[INSERT...]` placeholders with your specific rule information
4. Include the session logging requirements section
5. Provide the completed prompt to GitHub Copilot
6. **Copilot will log the complete prompt you used in chat and the prompt file source**
7. Copilot will create the rule in copilot-rules.md with NOT ACTIVE status AND log all actions

### For Prompt 2 (Rule + Link):
1. **ENSURE SESSION LOGGING IS ACTIVE** - Verify you are in a logged session before proceeding
2. Copy the prompt template
