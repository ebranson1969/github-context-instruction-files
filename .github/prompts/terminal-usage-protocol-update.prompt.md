# Terminal Usage Protocol Update Prompt

## What This Prompt Is For
This prompt is designed to help AI assistants update an existing **Terminal Usage Protocol** rule in GitHub Copilot instruction systems. Use this prompt when you need to modify, enhance, or fix an existing terminal usage protocol while maintaining backward compatibility and system integration.

## How to Use This Prompt

### When to Use
- **Enhancing existing rules**: Adding new features or capabilities to current protocol
- **Fixing issues**: Resolving problems or ambiguities in current implementation
- **Status changes**: Activating, deactivating, or modifying protocol enforcement
- **Compatibility updates**: Addressing new OS versions, bash updates, or integration requirements

### Usage Examples

**Example 1: Enhancement Update**
```
User: "Update our Terminal Usage Protocol to include support for Docker commands within bash."

AI Response: [Uses this prompt to enhance existing protocol with Docker integration guidelines while preserving current bash requirements]
```

**Example 2: Status Activation**
```
User: "Activate our Terminal Usage Protocol - change it from NOT ACTIVE to ACTIVE status."

AI Response: [Uses this prompt to update status, add activation requirements, and ensure protocol is ready for enforcement]
```

**Example 3: Restriction Updates**
```
User: "Add restrictions for zsh-specific syntax to our Terminal Usage Protocol."

AI Response: [Uses this prompt to add new prohibited terminal types while maintaining existing restrictions and providing clear migration guidance]
```

**Example 4: Compatibility Fix**
```
User: "Our Terminal Usage Protocol conflicts with the new CI/CD requirements. Update it to work with both."

AI Response: [Uses this prompt to resolve integration conflicts while preserving core functionality]
```

### Expected Workflow
1. **Analyze Current State**: Review existing Terminal Usage Protocol implementation
2. **Identify Changes Needed**: Determine what updates are required and why
3. **Apply This Prompt**: Use the structured guidance below to plan updates
4. **Implement Changes**: Modify the protocol with proper change documentation
5. **Validate Integration**: Ensure compatibility with other copilot rules
6. **Deploy**: Activate updated protocol and monitor for issues
