# Workflows Creation Prompts

*Project prompts for creating and managing workflows in the copilot system*

**üö® CRITICAL: Session Logging Requirements (NON-NEGOTIABLE)**
All workflow creation activities must be properly logged according to the Session Context Preservation Rule and Question Processing Rule. The requirements in this section are MANDATORY and must be followed for every workflow prompt and implementation.

**Session Logging Protocol Enforcement:**
- Session logging MUST be the first and last action for every user request, regardless of the task.
- Session logging is a gating requirement: no other actions (file edits, commits, etc.) may be performed until the session log is updated.
- The agent MUST verify the session log after every user interaction and before ending its turn, ensuring no step is missed.
- The session must be logged in the appropriate project directory.
- All research, reasoning, and file modifications must be documented.
- Git commits must be tracked and logged to maintain audit trail.
- Session logging continues throughout the workflow implementation process.
- **The exact prompt used in chat must be logged in the session log.**
- **The prompt file location (.github/prompts/workflows-prompt.md) must be documented.**
- **No workflow implementation is considered complete unless these logging requirements are fully met**

## Prompt 2: Add Workflow and Reference Link

### Prompt Template
```
I need you to create a complete workflow implementation with both the workflow definition and reference link.

Step 1: Add the workflow to copilot-workflows.md using Template 4 from .github/copilot-templates.md
Step 2: Add the reference link to copilot-instructions.md using Template 3 from .github/copilot-templates.md

Workflow Information:
- Workflow Name: [INSERT WORKFLOW NAME HERE]
- Workflow Description: [INSERT WHAT THIS WORKFLOW ESTABLISHES OR CONTROLS]
- Purpose Description: [INSERT PURPOSE DESCRIPTION FOR REFERENCE LINK]
- Reference Description: [INSERT DESCRIPTION FOR THE LINK TEXT]

Protocol Sections:
- [INSERT PROTOCOL/SECTION NAME 1]: [INSERT BRIEF DESCRIPTION]

- Document research and reasoning for both workflow design and reference placement
- Track file modifications to both copilot-workflows.md and copilot-instructions.md
- Log git commit message when changes are pushed
- Document the relationship between the workflow and existing protocols

## Usage Instructions

### For Prompt 1 (Workflow Only):
1. **ENSURE SESSION LOGGING IS ACTIVE** - Verify you are in a logged session before proceeding
2. Copy the prompt template
3. Replace all `[INSERT...]` placeholders with your specific workflow information
4. Include the session logging requirements section
5. Provide the completed prompt to GitHub Copilot
6. **Copilot will log the complete prompt you used in chat and the prompt file source**
7. Copilot will create the workflow in copilot-workflows.md with NOT ACTIVE status AND log all actions

### For Prompt 2 (Workflow + Link):
1. **ENSURE SESSION LOGGING IS ACTIVE** - Verify you are in a logged session before proceeding
2. Copy the prompt template  
3. Replace all `[INSERT...]` placeholders with your specific workflow information
4. Specify where in copilot-instructions.md the reference link should be added
5. Include comprehensive session logging requirements for both files
6. Provide the completed prompt to GitHub Copilot
7. **Copilot will log the complete prompt you used in chat and the prompt file source**
8. Copilot will create both the workflow definition and the reference link AND log all actions comprehensively

### Session Logging Integration Benefits:
- **Audit Trail**: Complete documentation of all workflow creation decisions and modifications
- **Traceability**: Links between workflow design rationale and implementation choices
- **Project History**: Maintains context for future workflow modifications and related decisions
- **Quality Assurance**: Ensures all workflow creation follows established documentation protocols
- **Team Collaboration**: Provides complete context for team members working on related workflows
- **Prompt Traceability**: Complete record of which prompts were used from which files
- **Reproducibility**: Ability to recreate workflow creation processes using documented prompts

### Template References:
- **Template 3**: For copilot-instructions.md workflow references (found in .github/copilot-templates.md)
- **Template 4**: For copilot-workflows.md workflow structure (found in .github/copilot-templates.md)

### Best Practices:
- **Always verify session logging is active** before using these prompts
- Start with NOT ACTIVE status for new workflows and test thoroughly before activation
- Use clear, descriptive protocol section names that align with existing workflow patterns
- Include specific, actionable requirements in bullet points
- Reference existing workflows as examples when creating similar functionality
- **Document rationale for workflow design decisions** in session logs for future reference
- **Track relationships between new workflows and existing protocols** to maintain system coherence
