## ðŸŽ¬ Scene 1: The Deadline Dilemma
*Setting: MegaCommerce Inc. office, Thursday 4:30 PM. The development floor is bustling with end-of-week energy.*

**SARAH** *(typing frantically, glances at clock)*: Come on, come on... just need to finish this authentication endpoint and I can submit my pull request before the code freeze tomorrow.

**MARCUS** *(walking by with coffee)*: Hey Sarah, how's the login feature coming along?

**SARAH**: Just finished! It's working perfectly in my testing. Users can log in, get their JWT tokens, everything's smooth. I'm thinking of pushing it up for review.

**MARCUS** *(sits down)*: Hold up there, speed racer. Authentication code? That's security-critical stuff. You know Emma's going to want to review every line, and I need to do a thorough code review too.

**SARAH** *(sighs)*: But Marcus, if I don't get this in today, it won't make it into Friday's deployment. The product team is expecting this feature for the weekend sale launch.

**MARCUS**: I get the pressure, but rushing authentication code is how we end up with security vulnerabilities. Remember the login bug from last quarter? Alex was up all night fixing customer lockouts.

**ALEX** *(overhearing from nearby desk)*: Did someone say authentication bug? *shivers* Please tell me we're not rushing security code again.

**SARAH**: No, no! I'm not rushing it. I just... I want to make sure it's really ready before bothering everyone for reviews. Is there a way I can get some preliminary feedback first?

## ðŸŽ¬ Scene 2: Discovering AI-Assisted Code Review
*Marcus pulls up the project documentation on his screen*

**MARCUS**: Actually, there is. We have these AI prompt templates specifically for this situation. Let me show you something...

*(Marcus navigates to the project's `.github/prompts/` directory)*

**MARCUS**: See this? We have standardized prompts for different scenarios. There's one specifically for authentication security reviews. Instead of bothering Emma and me with half-baked code, you can use AI to get structured feedback first.

**SARAH**: AI? For code review? Isn't that just going to give me generic advice like "use strong passwords"?

**MARCUS**: Not with these prompts. Watch this. *(opens code-review-authentication-security.md)* This template is designed specifically for our type of work. It knows about our tech stack, our security requirements, even our performance needs.

**EMMA** *(approaching)*: Did I hear someone talking about authentication and AI? *(skeptical)* Please tell me you're not trusting AI to catch security vulnerabilities.

**MARCUS**: No, Emma. Think of it as a pre-flight check. The AI won't replace your security review, but it can catch obvious issues before Sarah even submits the PR. That way, when you do review it, you can focus on the subtle security concerns instead of basic mistakes.

**EMMA**: Hmm... if it's catching the obvious stuff first, I suppose that could save me time. Show me what this looks like.

## ðŸŽ¬ Scene 3: The AI Prompt in Action
*The team gathers around Sarah's monitor*

**SARAH**: Okay, so I copy this template... *(reading)* "Project Prompt Example 0: Code Review Scenario." It has sections for the scenario, context, and code.

**MARCUS**: Exactly. Now you customize it with your specific situation. Don't just copy-paste blindly - the AI needs context about what you're actually building.

**SARAH** *(typing)*: So under "Scenario Description" I put... 
> "I'm implementing a user authentication endpoint for our e-commerce platform. It needs to handle 1000+ concurrent logins during flash sales and integrate with our legacy user database."

**EMMA**: Good, you mentioned the performance requirements and legacy constraints. The AI needs to know those limitations.

**SARAH**: And for "Context Information"... 
> "We're using Node.js, Express, MongoDB, and JWT tokens. We have PCI DSS compliance requirements and can't break compatibility with our existing mobile app."

**ALEX**: Perfect! You mentioned the compliance stuff. That's crucial context.

**SARAH**: Now I paste my actual code... *(copies her authentication endpoint code)*

**MARCUS**: Here's the key part - look at the "Applied Prompt Template" section. It shows you exactly how to format your request to the AI.

**SARAH** *(reading the template)*: 
> "I need a comprehensive code review focusing on security vulnerabilities, performance optimization, and adherence to best practices for authentication systems..."

**EMMA**: See how specific that is? It's not just asking "is this code good?" - it's asking for specific types of analysis.

## ðŸŽ¬ Scene 4: The AI Response and Team Learning
*Sarah submits the prompt to the AI and gets a detailed response*

**SARAH** *(reading AI output)*: Wow, this is detailed! It found several issues I completely missed:

1. **No rate limiting** - The AI says this could be a DDoS target
2. **Information leakage** - My error messages might tell attackers if an email exists
3. **No audit logging** - Security events aren't being recorded
4. **Database query optimization** - The User.findOne could be indexed better

**EMMA** *(impressed)*: Those are legitimate security concerns. The rate limiting issue especially - that could take down our entire login system during an attack.

**ALEX**: And the database optimization! During flash sales, those User.findOne queries could become a bottleneck.

**MARCUS**: This is exactly what the prompt system is for. Sarah, you just got senior-level feedback in 30 seconds instead of waiting for Monday's code review meeting.

**SARAH**: So now I can fix these issues and then submit for human review?

**EMMA**: Exactly. When you submit the PR, I can focus on architectural security concerns and edge cases, instead of catching basic mistakes.

---

## ðŸŽ¬ Scene 5: The Fix and Final Review
*One hour later, Sarah has implemented the AI's suggestions*

**SARAH**: Okay, I've added:
- Rate limiting with express-rate-limit
- Proper error messages that don't leak information  
- Audit logging for all authentication events
- Database indexing on the email field
- Input validation and sanitization

**MARCUS** *(reviewing the updated code)*: This looks much more robust. The AI caught things I might have missed in a quick review.

**EMMA**: I can see the security improvements. Now when I do my detailed review, I can focus on threat modeling and advanced attack scenarios instead of basic hygiene issues.

**ALEX**: And I love the audit logging - that'll make debugging production issues so much easier.

**SARAH**: So I can submit this PR now?

**MARCUS**: Absolutely. This is exactly how the system should work:
1. **AI review first** - catches obvious issues quickly
2. **Human review second** - focuses on complex concerns
3. **Everyone wins** - faster development, better security, less stress

**EMMA**: I approve of this workflow. The AI doesn't replace security expertise, but it makes our human review time more valuable.

## ðŸŽ¬ Scene 6: The Bigger Picture
*The team reflects on what they learned*

**ALEX**: You know what I love about this? Sarah gets immediate feedback instead of waiting days for a review slot.

**SARAH**: And I learn faster too. Instead of Marcus explaining the same basic security principles to every developer, the AI teaches us consistently.

**MARCUS**: That's the real benefit. These prompts codify our team's knowledge. New developers can get the same quality feedback that took me years to learn.

**EMMA**: Plus, the AI is never tired or in a bad mood. It gives thorough feedback every time, even at 4:30 PM on Thursday.

**SARAH**: I'm definitely using this for my next feature. It's like having a senior developer available 24/7.

**MARCUS**: Just remember - AI is a tool, not a replacement. Use it for the first pass, but always get human eyes on security-critical code.

**EMMA**: Agreed. But this tool makes both the AI review and human review more effective. Win-win.
