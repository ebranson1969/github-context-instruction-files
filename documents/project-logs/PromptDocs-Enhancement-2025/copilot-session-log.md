---

## Question 1
- **Timestamp:** September 29, 2025, 00:00:00.000
- **Original Question:** I need you to create a new logged session that will gover over updating and creating documentation for project.prompt.md. Please give it a good name. PromptDocs-Enhancement-2025.
- **Restatement:** Initiate a new session log named `PromptDocs-Enhancement-2025` to track all documentation updates and creation for `project.prompt.md`.

---

## Research & Reasoning
- **Session Logging Protocol:** Followed .github/copilot-instructions.md for session initiation and log file naming.
- **Project Name:** Chosen as `PromptDocs-Enhancement-2025` for clarity and future reference.
- **Log Location:** Created under `documents/project-logs/PromptDocs-Enhancement-2025/copilot-session-log.md` as required.
- **Context Dependencies:** This session will reference prior documentation logs if needed and maintain continuity per protocol.
- **Impact:** Ensures all documentation changes for `project.prompt.md` are fully auditable and context is preserved.

---

## Change Documentation
- **File Created:** documents/project-logs/PromptDocs-Enhancement-2025/copilot-session-log.md
- **Change Summary:** Initialized session log for documentation governance of `project.prompt.md`.

---

## Question 2
- **Timestamp:** December 20, 2024, 15:30:00.000
- **Original Question:** In documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide, I need you to move anything releated to project=prompts to be moved tho a validly named subfolder
- **Restatement:** Organize the copilot-instructions-guide directory by moving all project prompts related documentation into a properly named subfolder.

---

## Research & Reasoning - Question 2
- **Directory Analysis:** Examined documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/ and found:
  - project-prompts-guide.md - Main guide for project.prompt.md usage
  - project-prompts-detailed-guide.md - Detailed implementation guide for project prompts
  - Other files: copilot-instructions-guide.md, git-commit-instructions-guide.md, project-instructions-guide.md, README.md, examples/
- **Files to Move:** Identified two files specifically related to project prompts that should be moved
- **Subfolder Name:** Will create "project-prompts/" subfolder for clear organization
- **Alternative Approaches:** Could use "prompts/" but "project-prompts/" is more descriptive and aligns with file naming
- **Impact Assessment:** This reorganization will improve documentation structure and make project prompt guides easier to locate
- **Context Dependencies:** Need to update README.md files to reflect new structure and maintain proper linking

---

## Change Documentation - Question 2
- **Directory Created:** documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/project-prompts/
- **Files Moved:** 
  - project-prompts-guide.md → project-prompts/project-prompts-guide.md
  - project-prompts-detailed-guide.md → project-prompts/project-prompts-detailed-guide.md
- **File Created:** documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/project-prompts/README.md
- **File Updated:** documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/README.md
- **Change Summary:** Successfully reorganized project prompt documentation into dedicated subfolder with proper README structure and parent directory linking
- **Git Operations:** Used `git mv` commands to preserve file history during reorganization

**Git Commit:** `c50a6b6` - `Auto-commit: Reorganize project prompts documentation into dedicated subfolder`

---

## Question 3
- **Timestamp:** December 20, 2024, 15:45:00.000
- **Original Question:** The examples should be moved as well
- **Restatement:** Move the examples directory from copilot-instructions-guide into the project-prompts subfolder since the examples are specifically related to project prompt usage.

---

## Research & Reasoning - Question 3
- **Context Analysis:** User has identified that the examples directory contains project prompt-related examples and should be moved to the project-prompts subfolder for better organization
- **Directory Review:** The examples/ directory contains 8 detailed examples demonstrating AI prompt usage in realistic business scenarios
- **Logical Grouping:** Since examples demonstrate project prompt usage, they belong with the project prompt documentation
- **Impact Assessment:** This will create a more cohesive documentation structure where all project prompt related content is together
- **Alternative Approaches:** Could keep examples separate, but consolidation makes more sense for user experience
- **Context Dependencies:** Need to update README files to reflect the new examples location and maintain proper navigation

---

## Change Documentation - Question 3
- **Directory Moved:** examples/ → project-prompts/examples/
- **File Updated:** documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/README.md (removed separate examples section, updated directory structure)
- **File Updated:** documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/project-prompts/README.md (added examples section and navigation)
- **Change Summary:** Successfully moved examples directory into project-prompts subfolder, creating a cohesive documentation structure where all project prompt related content is consolidated together
- **Git Operations:** Used `git mv` command to preserve file history during directory move

**Git Commit:** `5439eaa` - `Auto-commit: Move examples directory to project-prompts subfolder for better organization`

---

## Question 4
- **Timestamp:** December 20, 2024, 16:00:00.000
- **Original Question:** For just 1 of the examples in documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/project-prompts/examples can you create a file that would go over a real world example of how that file would be used. The md should use the actors, a development team, to demonstrate how we could use the promt. Create it like a play. Be as descriptive and assume I know nothing. Use documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/project-prompts/examples/code-review-authentication-security.md
- **Restatement:** Create a theatrical play-style demonstration file showing a real development team using the code-review-authentication-security.md example prompt in a realistic workplace scenario.

---

## Research & Reasoning - Question 4
- **Example Analysis:** Examined code-review-authentication-security.md and found it contains a realistic e-commerce authentication scenario with Node.js/Express code
- **Play Structure:** Will create a theatrical script showing Sarah (developer), Marcus (senior dev), and Emma (security engineer) working through a real code review scenario
- **Educational Approach:** Structure it as a workplace drama to make the learning engaging and memorable
- **Target Audience:** Assume reader knows nothing about AI prompts or code review processes
- **Demonstration Goals:** Show the complete workflow from problem identification to AI prompt usage to resolution
- **File Location:** Will create the play as a companion file next to the original example
- **Alternative Approaches:** Could create a simple tutorial, but theatrical format makes complex concepts more accessible

---

## Change Documentation - Question 4
- **File Created:** documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/project-prompts/examples/code-review-authentication-security-DEMO.md
- **Change Summary:** Created a comprehensive theatrical play-style demonstration showing how a real development team would use the code-review-authentication-security.md prompt in a workplace scenario
- **Educational Features:**
  - 6 scenes showing complete workflow from problem to solution
  - 4 realistic characters representing different roles (developer, senior dev, security engineer, DevOps)
  - Real workplace dialogue and technical challenges
  - Step-by-step demonstration of AI prompt usage
  - Clear explanation of benefits and proper workflow
  - Practical "Try This Yourself" section for readers

**Git Commit:** `[commit completed]` - `Auto-commit: Create theatrical demonstration for code review authentication security prompt usage`
