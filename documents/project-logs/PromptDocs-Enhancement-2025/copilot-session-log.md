## Question 2
- **Timestamp:** December 20, 2024, 15:30:00.000
- **Original Question:** In documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide, I need you to move anything releated to project=prompts to be moved tho a validly named subfolder
- **Restatement:** Organize the copilot-instructions-guide directory by moving all project prompts related documentation into a properly named subfolder.

---

## Research & Reasoning - Question 2
- **Directory Analysis:** Examined documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/ and found:
  - project-prompts-guide.md - Main guide for project.prompt.md usage
  - project-prompts-detailed-guide.md - Detailed implementation guide for project prompts
  - Other files: copilot-instructions-guide.md, git-commit-instructions-guide.md, project-instructions-guide.md, README.md, examples/
- **Files to Move:** Identified two files specifically related to project prompts that should be moved
- **Subfolder Name:** Will create "project-prompts/" subfolder for clear organization
- **Alternative Approaches:** Could use "prompts/" but "project-prompts/" is more descriptive and aligns with file naming
- **Impact Assessment:** This reorganization will improve documentation structure and make project prompt guides easier to locate
- **Context Dependencies:** Need to update README.md files to reflect new structure and maintain proper linking

---

## Change Documentation - Question 2
- **Directory Created:** documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/project-prompts/
- **Files Moved:** 
  - project-prompts-guide.md → project-prompts/project-prompts-guide.md
  - project-prompts-detailed-guide.md → project-prompts/project-prompts-detailed-guide.md
- **File Created:** documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/project-prompts/README.md
- **File Updated:** documents/guides/copilot-instructions-guide/README.md
- **Change Summary:** Successfully reorganized project prompt documentation into dedicated subfolder with proper README structure and parent directory linking
- **Git Operations:** Used `git mv` commands to preserve file history during reorganization
