## Document Descriptions

### üìÅ **[GitHub Context Organization Project](github-context-organization/)**
**Consolidated GitHub Context Instruction Files Optimization Project**
- **Purpose**: Unified session logging for all GitHub context instruction files optimization and organization efforts
- **Coverage**: Session management protocols, question processing workflows, file modifications tracking, git commit correlation, context preservation
- **Usage**: Active development sessions for optimizing copilot instruction files, maintaining audit trails, preserving context across sessions
- **Target Audience**: Development teams working on copilot instruction optimization, project managers tracking AI-assisted development
- **When to Use**: During active development sessions on GitHub context files, when tracking optimization progress, for session continuity
- **Contains**: Complete session log with timestamped questions, research documentation, file modifications, and git commit tracking
- **Status**: Active project with ongoing optimization efforts

#### **Session Log: copilot-session-log.md**
**Comprehensive Development Session Documentation**
- **Purpose**: Detailed log of all AI-assisted development sessions for the GitHub context instruction files project
- **Coverage**: Question tracking, research reasoning, file modifications, git commits, context preservation protocols
- **Usage**: Maintaining session continuity, audit trails, decision documentation, learning from past sessions
- **Format**: Timestamped entries with original questions, AI reasoning, actions taken, and file changes
- **Target Audience**: Development teams, project managers, auditors, future session participants
- **When to Use**: Every development session, context recovery, project retrospectives, audit reviews

**Project Consolidation History:**
This project represents the consolidation of previous separate optimization efforts (September 30, 2025):
- Original `github-context-optimization` project (September 27, 2025)
- `github-prompts-optimization` project (empty logs)
- Combined into single unified project for better resource management and reduced redundancy

## Session Log Structure

Each project log follows the standardized format established by the Question Processing Rule:

### Header Information
- **Project Name:** Clear identifier for the session
- **Focus Area:** Specific files or components being worked on
- **Objective:** Primary goals and expected outcomes

### Question Log Format
Each question entry includes:
- **Timestamp:** When the question was asked (Month DD, YYYY, HH:MM:SS.mmm format)
- **Original Question:** User's exact request verbatim
- **Question Restatement:** AI's interpretation for clarity
- **Research and Reasoning:** Analysis and decision-making process
- **Actions Taken:** Specific steps and modifications made
- **File Modifications:** Detailed change documentation with file paths
- **Git Commit Logging:** Correlation with version control history

## Usage Guidelines

1. **Session Continuity**: Use existing logs to maintain context across sessions
2. **Audit Trail**: Reference logs for understanding past decisions and changes
3. **Context Recovery**: Use logs to restore session context when AI context degrades
4. **Project Tracking**: Monitor optimization progress and decision rationale
5. **Knowledge Sharing**: Share insights and lessons learned across team members
