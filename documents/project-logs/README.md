# Project Logs Documentation

This directory contains session logs for various projects and optimization efforts related to the GitHub Context Instruction Files system.

## Purpose

The project-logs system provides comprehensive documentation of AI-assisted development sessions, including:
- Question tracking and analysis
- Research and reasoning documentation
- File modifications and changes
- Git commit history linking
- Context preservation across sessions

## Current Project Logs

### ðŸ“Š [GitHub Context Optimization](github-context-optimization/)
- **Focus:** Original optimization project for GitHub context instruction files
- **Session Log:** `copilot-session-log.md`
- **Status:** Completed - Protocol framework established
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Implemented session management rules
  - Established question processing protocols
  - Created git commit logging system
  - Developed fast terminal-based logging

### ðŸŽ¯ [GitHub Prompts Optimization](github-prompts-optimization/)
- **Focus:** Analysis and optimization of `.github/prompts/project.prompt.md`
- **Session Log:** `copilot-session-log.md`
- **Status:** Active - Documentation and guides creation
- **Key Achievements:**
  - Consolidated git operations workflow
  - Created comprehensive guide system
  - Analyzed git verification capabilities
  - Organized documentation structure

## Session Log Structure

Each project log follows the standardized format:

### Header Information
- **Project Name:** Clear identifier for the session
- **Focus Area:** Specific files or components being worked on
- **Objective:** Primary goals and expected outcomes

### Question Log Format
Each question entry includes:
- **Timestamp:** When the question was asked
- **Original Question:** User's exact request
- **Question Restatement:** AI's interpretation for clarity
- **Research and Reasoning:** Analysis and decision-making process
- **Actions Taken:** Specific steps and modifications made
- **File Modifications:** Detailed change documentation

### Git Integration
- **Commit Tracking:** Links session changes to git commits
- **Hash Documentation:** Preserves commit hashes for traceability
- **Change Correlation:** Maps session activities to version control

## Logging Protocol Rules

### Session Management
- **Rule 1:** Sessions initiated by explicit project name or context continuation
- **Rule 2:** Logs stored under `project-logs/<ProjectName>/copilot-session-log.md`

### Question Processing
- **Rule 1:** Log timestamp, original question, and restatement
- **Rule 2:** Document research steps and reasoning process
- **Rule 3:** Record all file modifications with change summaries
- **Rule Final:** Log git commit messages with hashes
- **Rule Optimize:** Fast terminal-based summary logging

## Using Project Logs

### For Developers
- Review session context before continuing work
- Understand reasoning behind changes
- Track evolution of project decisions
- Learn from documented approaches

### For Project Management
- Monitor development progress
- Understand time investment in different areas
- Identify recurring issues or patterns
- Track completion of objectives

### For Documentation
- Source material for project documentation
- Historical context for design decisions
- Examples of problem-solving approaches
- Reference for future similar projects

## Creating New Project Logs

When starting a new project session:
1. Create directory: `project-logs/<ProjectName>/`
2. Initialize log file: `copilot-session-log.md`
3. Include project context header
4. Follow established question logging format
5. Maintain git commit correlation

## Maintenance

### Regular Tasks
- Archive completed project logs
- Update status information
- Cross-reference related projects
- Verify git commit links remain valid

### Quality Control
- Ensure consistent formatting
- Validate documentation completeness
- Check cross-references accuracy
- Maintain timestamp consistency
