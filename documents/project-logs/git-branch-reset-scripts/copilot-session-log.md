# Copilot Session Log - Git Branch Reset Scripts

## Session Information
- **Project Name**: Git Branch Reset Scripts
- **Session Start**: October 7, 2025
- **Question Type**: Feature Request
- **Project Area**: scripts
- **Priority Level**: High
- **Session Type**: START

## Session Overview
User requested creation/update of scripts that will reset the current branch to match origin/master exactly, including:
1. Ensuring we're on the master branch
2. Resetting to origin/master
3. Reverting all disk changes to match master
4. Removing new files and restoring deleted files

## Question 1 - Script Creation Request
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-07 - Session Start

**User Request Summary**:
- Update scripts in the scripts/ folder to reset branch to origin/master
- Ensure complete reset: changed files reverted, new files removed, deleted files restored
- Follow session management protocols
- Wait for approval before making changes (except logs)

**Research Phase**:
- Examined master prompt instructions and session management protocol
- Found 4 script files in scripts/ folder:
  - copy_github_to_root.cmd (Windows batch)
  - copy_github_to_root.py (Python)
  - copy_github_to_root.sh (Bash)
  - copy_github_to_root.zsh (Zsh)
- **IMPORTANT DISCOVERY**: Scripts are NOT empty as initially appeared - they contain full git reset functionality

**Current Script Analysis**:
All scripts already implement the requested functionality:
1. ✅ Switch to master branch (`git checkout master`)
2. ✅ Fetch from origin (`git fetch origin`)
3. ✅ Hard reset to origin/master (`git reset --hard origin/master`)
4. ✅ Clean untracked files (`git clean -fd`)
5. ✅ Copy .github files to root (additional functionality)

**Issues Identified**:
1. **Bash Script**: Syntax error in find command pipe (missing pipe symbol)
2. **Zsh Script**: Same syntax error in find command pipe
3. **All Scripts**: Names suggest "copy_github_to_root" but they do full git reset + copy
4. **Naming Convention**: Script names don't clearly indicate they perform git reset operations

**Plan Outlined** (Awaiting User Approval):
1. **Fix Critical Syntax Errors**:
   - Bash script: Fix missing pipe symbol in `find` command
   - Zsh script: Fix same missing pipe symbol in `find` command
   
2. **Optional Improvements** (User can decide):
   - Consider renaming scripts to better reflect functionality (e.g., `git-reset-to-master.*`)
   - Add confirmation prompt before executing destructive operations
   - Improve error handling for edge cases

3. **Current Functionality Verification**:
   - Scripts already perform exactly what you requested:
     ✅ Ensure on master branch
     ✅ Reset to origin/master (hard reset)
     ✅ Revert all disk changes to match master
     ✅ Remove new files (git clean -fd)
     ✅ Restore deleted files (git reset --hard does this)

4. **Additional Features Already Present**:
   - Session logging with timestamps
   - Error handling and exit codes
   - Progress reporting
   - Cross-platform support (Windows, Linux, macOS)
   - Copy .github files to root (bonus functionality)

**Recommended Action**: Fix only the syntax errors since the core functionality already meets your requirements perfectly.

**Status**: Plan created, awaiting user approval to proceed with script updates

**CORRECTION NEEDED**: Missing critical session management requirements:
- Must create original prompt file in project logs directory
- Must create continuation prompt file for future sessions
- These are mandatory per master prompt instructions

**Updated Plan** (Awaiting User Approval):
1. **Create Missing Session Management Files**:
   - Copy original prompt to `documents/project-logs/git-branch-reset-scripts/original-prompt.md`
   - Create continuation prompt at `documents/project-logs/git-branch-reset-scripts/continuation-prompt.md`
   
2. **Fix Critical Syntax Errors**:
   - Bash script: Fix missing pipe symbol in `find` command
   - Zsh script: Fix same missing pipe symbol in `find` command

**Status**: Corrected plan ready, awaiting user approval to proceed

## Question 2 - Missing Session Management Files
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-07 - User Correction

**User Correction**:
- User pointed out missing mandatory prompt files from master prompt instructions
- These are required for proper session management protocol compliance

**Action Taken**:
✅ **Created `original-prompt.md`** - Complete copy of original user prompt with master prompt instructions embedded
✅ **Created `continuation-prompt.md`** - Modified version for future sessions:
  - Changed session type from START to RESTART
  - Replaced question section with placeholder for future questions
  - Maintained all other sections exactly as original

**Files Created**:
- `documents/project-logs/git-branch-reset-scripts/original-prompt.md`
- `documents/project-logs/git-branch-reset-scripts/continuation-prompt.md`

**Current Status**: All mandatory session management files now complete. Ready to proceed with script fixes upon user approval.

## Question 3 - Log Management Clarification
**Timestamp**: 2025-10-07 - User Clarification

**User Request**:
- Clarified that logs should always be appended to, never overwritten (which I did correctly)
- Requested to include all previous questions in this log 
- Confirmed to continue with original question after log is complete

**Action Taken**:
✅ **Confirmed proper log management** - All updates have been appended, not overwritten
✅ **All questions documented** - Questions 1, 2, and 3 are now logged in chronological order
✅ **Session continuity maintained** - Ready to proceed with original script fix request

**Current Status**: Log is complete and properly maintained. Ready to proceed with original question about fixing script syntax errors upon user approval.
