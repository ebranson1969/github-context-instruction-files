# GitHub Context Optimization - Copilot Session Log

## Session Started: September 27, 2025

### Project Overview
Working on optimizing and improving the context instruction files in the `.github` directory of the ai-support project.

### Current Session Questions and Actions

#### Question 1 - Session Initiation (September 27, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "Lets start a new conversation. We are going to be making changes to the context instruction files in .github. Please give the conversation a good name"

**Question Restatement:** User wants to start a new logged session focused on modifying the GitHub context instruction files, and wants me to assign an appropriate project name.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Explored the `.github` directory structure
- Found existing files: `copilot-instructions.md`, `git-commit-instructions.md`, and subdirectories `instructions/` and `prompts/`
- Chose project name "github-context-optimization" as it clearly describes the focus on improving GitHub context instruction files
- Created session log under this project name following the established protocol

**Current File Analysis:**
1. **copilot-instructions.md** - Contains comprehensive coding standards, session logging protocol, and workflow requirements
2. **git-commit-instructions.md** - Defines commit message format, types, scopes, and examples
3. **instructions/project-instructions.md** - Currently empty file
4. **prompts/project.prompt.md** - Contains templated prompts for code review, documentation, bug analysis, feature implementation, and refactoring

**Actions Taken:**
- Listed contents of `.github` directory and subdirectories
- Read and analyzed existing context files
- Created new session log file at `documents/project-logs/github-context-optimization/copilot-session-log.md`

#### Question 2 - Protocol Continuation (September 27, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "We are going to be working on the Copilot Session Logging Protocol. You can find more context for what we have currently done in documents/project-logs/copilot-protocol-development/copilot-session-log.md. Just update our context session from the previous and create a file in our project log so that you can use it."

**Question Restatement:** User wants to continue working on the Copilot Session Logging Protocol development, referencing the previous session's comprehensive work, and wants me to update our current session context with the previous context and create a protocol working file in our project logs.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Applied Rule 1: Previous context provided, logging continues automatically for github-context-optimization session
- Reviewed the complete copilot-protocol-development session log which shows:
  - Full development of 5 protocol rules from initial framework to implementation
  - Complete session history with 13 logged questions
  - Successful demonstration of protocol effectiveness
  - Protocol rules: Session Initiation, Session Storage, Question Logging, Research Documentation, Change Documentation
- Current session focus shifts to continuing protocol development work within the github-context-optimization scope
- Need to create a protocol working file to continue development

**Actions Taken:**
- Updated current session log with protocol continuation context
