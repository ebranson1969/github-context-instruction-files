# Copilot Session Logging Protocol - Development Workspace

## Protocol Status Summary
**Current Version:** 1.0 (Implemented)
**Location:** `.github/copilot-instructions.md`
**Status:** Active and Functional

## Existing Protocol Rules (Implemented)

### Rule 1: Session Initiation Protocol
- User explicitly indicates when session requires logging by providing project name
- User may provide location with previous conversation history for context continuation
- Sessions only logged when explicitly requested (exception: previous context logging continues automatically)
- All logging associated with clearly identified project name

### Rule 2: Session Storage Protocol
- Project logs stored under `documents/project-logs/<ProjectName>/`
- Context logging file: markdown file named `copilot-session-log.md`
- Each project maintains dedicated logging directory and file
- Full path format: `documents/project-logs/<ProjectName>/copilot-session-log.md`

### Rule 3: Question Logging Protocol
- Log timestamp when question was asked
- Record user's original question verbatim
- Provide restatement of question in own words for clarity
- Use consistent formatting for question entries

### Rule 4: Research and Reasoning Documentation Protocol
- Document all research steps before making changes or providing solutions
- Log reasoning process, including alternative approaches considered
- Record failed attempts and why they didn't work
- Cache all findings and decision-making rationale in session log
- Include tool usage and exploration steps

### Rule 5: Change Documentation Protocol
- Log all file modifications made during session
- Record which files were created, edited, or deleted
- Include brief summaries of what was changed and why
- Provide file paths and change descriptions for easy reference
- Link changes back to reasoning documented in Rule 4

## Next Development Areas

### Potential Rule 6 Candidates
1. **Git Operations Logging** - Track commit IDs, git operations, and repository changes
2. **Error Handling Protocol** - Document how to handle protocol failures or interruptions
3. **Session Cross-References** - Link related sessions and maintain project continuity
4. **Context Compression** - Handle large sessions that approach token limits
5. **Multi-Agent Collaboration** - Protocol for multiple AI agents working on same project

### Implementation Notes
- Protocol successfully tested in copilot-protocol-development session
- All 5 rules actively demonstrated and proven effective
- Currently integrated into main copilot-instructions.md file
- Ready for further enhancement and rule expansion

## Current Session Focus
Working within github-context-optimization project to continue protocol development while optimizing GitHub context instruction files.
