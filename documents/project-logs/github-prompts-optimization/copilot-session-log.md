## Question Log

### Question 1 | September 28, 2025, 12:00:00.000

**Original Question:**
> I want to create a new conversation for the .github/prompts/project.prompt.md instruction file to go over what it does and to make changes to it. Just create the logging session for now

**Question Restatement:**
The user wants to initiate a focused conversation session about the project.prompt.md file located in .github/prompts/. This file appears to contain standardized prompts for AI interactions in various development scenarios (code review, documentation, bug analysis, feature implementation, and refactoring). The user wants to examine its current functionality and potentially make improvements, but for now just wants the logging session established.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Located the target file at `/Users/ericbranson/IdeaProjects/github-context-instruction-files/.github/prompts/project.prompt.md`
- File contains structured prompt templates for different AI interaction scenarios
- Current structure includes: Code Review, Documentation Generation, Bug Analysis, Feature Implementation, Code Refactoring prompts
- Also includes project-specific AI interaction patterns with context setting and response format guidelines
- This appears to be a framework for standardizing how team members interact with AI tools
- Session logging is being set up in dedicated project directory following established protocol

**Actions Taken:**
- Created new project logging directory: `documents/project-logs/github-prompts-optimization/`
- Initialized session log file: `copilot-session-log.md`
- Established session context and project objectives
- Ready for detailed analysis and optimization work on the prompts file

**Session Status:** ACTIVE - Ready for prompt file analysis and optimization
