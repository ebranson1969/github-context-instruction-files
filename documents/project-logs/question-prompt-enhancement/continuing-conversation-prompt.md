## Your Question/Request
I want you to restart this conversation, but the logging protocol seems broken, so we are going to fix that. 
1. only append to the log for now
2. Show me new changes first and then prompt me to make the change.
3. You can always append to the logs without asking. Follow the logging protocol for that.

**CRITICAL**: This session must be properly logged according to established protocols. Document all research, reasoning, and file modifications throughout this process.
