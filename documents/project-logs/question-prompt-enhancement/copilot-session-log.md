## Question Prompt Enhancement Session (October 5, 2025)

### Question 1 - Session Initiation and Enhancement Request (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** User provided the complete question prompt template and requested to enhance question-prompt.md. Specific requirements:
1. Start logging for this session
2. Create a copy of the prompt question file in the logging directory
3. Create an exact copy that addresses existing conversation with only the question changed
4. Modify the prompt so that for New Sessions, it will copy the prompt from chat and create an md file in the logging directory

**Question Restatement:** User wants to enhance the question-prompt.md template to automatically handle session logging and prompt copying, improving the workflow for managing new sessions and continuing existing conversations.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Analyzed current question-prompt.md structure in .github/prompts/
- Reviewed session management protocol requirements
- Identified need for automated prompt copying and session-specific logging
- Current template has basic structure but lacks automated logging integration
- Enhancement will streamline workflow for both new sessions and continuing conversations

**Prompt Source:** .github/prompts/question-prompt.md

**Complete User Prompt from Chat:**
```markdown
# Question Prompt Template

*For detailed explanations, examples, and usage instructions, see: [Question Prompt Guide](./guides/question-prompt-guide.md)*

## Template: General Question

```markdown
## Your Question/Request
I want you to start a session to address the following question: I want to enhance question-prompt.md. For now I just 
want you to start the logging. Create a copy of this prompt question file in the logging directory as well as create an exact copy but it 
will address the existing conversation and the only thing that will change is the question.

I also want you to change the prompt so that if it is a New Session you will copy the prompt I put in the chat and create a md file and put it with the logging directory.
s well as create an exact copy but it
will address the existing conversation and the only thing that will change is the question.

**CRITICAL**: This session must be properly logged according to established protocols. Document all research, reasoning, and file modifications throughout this process.

### Question 2 - Simplify Continuation Workflow (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "Do we really need question-prompt-continuing.md. question-prompt.md should always create the continuation promt in the logging directory. I would never use this to restart an existing conversation. I would using the one you created when you started the logging"

**Question Restatement:** User wants to eliminate the separate question-prompt-continuing.md file as it's redundant. The main template should always create the continuation prompt in the logging directory, and users would use that created copy for continuing sessions rather than a separate template file.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- User is correct that the separate continuing template is redundant
- The workflow should be: main template creates both original and continuation versions in logging directory
- Users would use the continuation version from the logging directory, not a separate .github/prompts file
- This simplifies the template system and reduces maintenance overhead
- More intuitive workflow: one main template that sets up everything needed

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Removed redundant `.github/prompts/question-prompt-continuing.md` file
2. ✅ Updated main template to clarify simplified workflow
3. ✅ Enhanced project-specific continuation prompt with better context
4. ✅ Updated automated logging instructions to reflect single-template approach

**Files Modified:**
- **Removed:** `.github/prompts/question-prompt-continuing.md` (redundant file deleted)
- **Updated:** `.github/prompts/question-prompt.md` (clarified simplified workflow)
- **Enhanced:** `documents/project-logs/question-prompt-enhancement/continuing-conversation-prompt.md` (project-specific template improved)

**Validation Results:**
- Main template validated with no syntax errors
- Simplified workflow now uses only one template that creates everything needed
- Project-specific continuation prompts are created automatically in logging directories
- Users always use the continuation prompt from their specific project's logging directory

**Workflow Simplification Achieved:**
- **Before:** Main template + separate continuing template in .github/prompts/
- **After:** Main template creates everything needed in project logging directory
- **User Experience:** Use main template for new sessions, use project-specific continuation prompt for additional questions
- **Maintenance:** Only one template to maintain in .github/prompts/

**Current Session Question Count:** 2

### Question 3 - Remove Usage Instructions from Template (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "Usage Instructions do not belong in the prompt file, they belong in the accomping guide."

**Question Restatement:** User wants to remove the usage instructions from the prompt template file since they should be in the accompanying guide, not in the template itself.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- User is correct that usage instructions should be separated from the template
- Template files should focus on the actual prompt structure
- Instructions and guidance belong in dedicated guide documentation
- This improves template clarity and maintains proper separation of concerns
- Template reference to guide already exists at the top of the file

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Removed "Usage Instructions" section from `.github/prompts/question-prompt.md`
2. ✅ Kept template focused on prompt structure only
3. ✅ Maintained reference to guide at top of template file

**Files Modified:**
- **Updated:** `.github/prompts/question-prompt.md` (removed usage instructions section)

**Validation Results:**
- Template is now cleaner and more focused
- Usage instructions properly belong in the accompanying guide
- Template maintains reference to guide for detailed instructions
- Improved separation of concerns between template and documentation

**Template Improvement Achieved:**
- **Before:** Template included both prompt structure and usage instructions
- **After:** Template focuses solely on prompt structure, with guide reference for instructions
- **Benefit:** Cleaner template, better organization, proper separation of concerns

**Current Session Question Count:** 3

**Git Commit Information for Questions 2-3:**

### Question 4 - Enforce Strict Template Content Rule (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "CAn you update the templet to say this? Only what is to be copied and put in hte chat should be in *-prompt.md, all help, examples and usage instructions belong in *-prompt-guide.md. This must be strictly followed."

**Question Restatement:** User wants to enforce strict separation where prompt files contain only the content to be copied to chat, while all help, examples, and usage instructions belong in the guide files.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- User is establishing a clear architectural rule for template organization
- Prompt files should contain only the actual prompt structure for copying
- All instructional content, examples, and guidance belongs in separate guide files
- This ensures clean separation and prevents confusion about what to copy
- Template was still containing some instructional sections that needed removal

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Removed "Automated Logging Instructions" section from template

**Validation Results:**
- Template now strictly follows the rule: only copyable content
- All instructional content properly belongs in the guide file
- Clean separation between template structure and guidance documentation
- Template is focused solely on the prompt to be used in chat

**Architectural Rule Enforced:**
- **Rule:** Only content to be copied to chat belongs in *-prompt.md files
- **All help, examples, usage instructions:** Belong in *-prompt-guide.md files
- **Template Content:** Pure prompt structure only
- **Guidance Content:** Separate guide files only

**Current Session Question Count:** 4

### Question 5 - Revert Strict Template Content Rule (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "Can you revert that last change. I need the usage instructions and automated logging info back in the prompt file."

**Question Restatement:** User wants to revert the last change that removed the usage instructions and automated logging information from the prompt file.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- User initially requested the strict content rule, but now needs the removed information back
- The usage instructions and automated logging information are deemed necessary for the prompt file
- Reverting will restore the previous functionality and information in the template

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Reverted `.github/prompts/question-prompt.md` to previous version with usage instructions and automated logging information
2. ✅ Pushed revert commit to remote repository

**Question Restatement:** User wants to restore the commit that enforced the strict template content rule, bringing back the changes that removed instructional content from the template file.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- User initially asked to revert the strict content rule, but now needs it back
- The rule ensures clean separation: *-prompt.md contains only copyable content
- All help, examples, and usage instructions belong in *-prompt-guide.md files
- This maintains proper architectural separation and prevents confusion about what to copy

### Question 7 - Update Template to Copy Sections for Continuation Prompts (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "I need you to update .github/prompts/prompt-creation-prompt.md. When you create the continuing-conversation-prompt.md, I want you to copy some sections from the original prompt message exactly as they are.
1. Project Information, except for Session Type, that should remain Continuing Session
2. Everything except for Your Question/Request, it should start with [REPLACE THIS WITH YOUR NEW QUESTION - This will be added to the existing session]"

**Question Restatement:** User wants to enhance the question-prompt.md template so that when creating continuation prompts, specific sections are copied exactly from the original prompt, maintaining consistency while only changing the question content and session type.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Need to enhance the automated logging workflow to copy more sections from original prompt
- Project Information should be copied but Session Type changed to "Continuing Session"
- All other sections should be copied exactly except "Your Question/Request" which gets the continuation placeholder
- This ensures consistency between original and continuation prompts
- Improves workflow by maintaining all original context and settings

**Actions Planned:**
1. Update the main question-prompt.md template instructions
2. Modify the automated logging workflow instructions
3. Ensure continuation prompts maintain full context from original

**Current Session Question Count:** 7

### Question 8 - Update Session Logging Protocol Default (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "Session Logging Protocol, default to yes"

**Question Restatement:** User wants to change the Session Logging Protocol in prompt-creation-prompt.md to default to YES instead of NO.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Current prompt-creation-prompt.md defaults to NO for session logging
- User wants session logging to be the default behavior for prompt creation tasks
- This aligns with the overall session management protocols established in the project
- Change improves consistency with other templates that default to session logging

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Updated `.github/prompts/prompt-creation-prompt.md` Session Logging Protocol section
2. ✅ Changed default from "NO ❌" to "YES ✅" 
3. ✅ Updated checkbox selection to have "YES" checked by default

### Question 9 - Enhance Filename Placeholder for Auto-Generation (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** User requested to update the filename placeholder from `[INSERT-KEBAB-CASE-FILENAME]` to `[AUTO-GENERATE-FROM-PROJECT-NAME-OR-CUSTOM]` to make it clear that filenames can be auto-generated from project names or customized by users.

**Question Restatement:** User wants to enhance the filename placeholder in prompt-creation-prompt.md to be more descriptive and indicate that it can auto-generate from project name or allow custom overrides.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Current placeholder `[INSERT-KEBAB-CASE-FILENAME]` doesn't clearly indicate auto-generation capability
- New placeholder `[AUTO-GENERATE-FROM-PROJECT-NAME-OR-CUSTOM]` is more descriptive
- This makes it clear to users that they can either let the system auto-generate or provide custom names
- Improves user experience by clarifying the dual functionality

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Updated both File Location and Guide File Location placeholders
2. ✅ Changed from `[INSERT-KEBAB-CASE-FILENAME]` to `[AUTO-GENERATE-FROM-PROJECT-NAME-OR-CUSTOM]`
3. ✅ Maintained consistency between prompt and guide file naming

**Files Modified:**
- **Updated:** `.github/prompts/prompt-creation-prompt.md` (enhanced filename placeholders)

**Validation Results:**
- Placeholder is now more descriptive and user-friendly
- Clearly indicates auto-generation capability from project names
- Allows for custom filename overrides when needed
- Improves template usability and clarity

**Enhancement Achieved:**
- **Before:** `[INSERT-KEBAB-CASE-FILENAME]` - unclear about auto-generation
- **After:** `[AUTO-GENERATE-FROM-PROJECT-NAME-OR-CUSTOM]` - clear dual functionality
- **Benefit:** Users understand they can use auto-generation or provide custom names

**Current Session Question Count:** 9

### Question 10 - Remove Redundant Template Structure Section (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** User questioned whether the "Template Structure" section is needed since it's already covered under the FOUNDATION section that references the Master Prompt Template, and asked me to show the proposed changes first, then said "do it."

**Question Restatement:** User wants to remove redundant sections from prompt-creation-prompt.md that duplicate the guidance already provided by the FOUNDATION reference to the master template.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- The "Template Structure" section was redundant with the FOUNDATION instruction
- The "Template Foundation" section also overlapped with the FOUNDATION guidance
- Users were getting three different sections telling them essentially the same thing
- Streamlining improves clarity and reduces confusion
- The master template already provides the structure, so users just need customization guidance

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Removed redundant "Template Structure:" section
2. ✅ Consolidated "Template Foundation:" into "Template Customization:"
3. ✅ Added optional field for describing unique sections specific to prompt type
4. ✅ Maintained all essential guidance while eliminating redundancy

**Files Modified:**
- **Updated:** `.github/prompts/prompt-creation-prompt.md` (removed redundant sections)

**Validation Results:**
- Template is now cleaner and more focused
- Eliminated confusing overlapping instructions
- Users have clear, single source of customization guidance
- All essential information preserved

**Streamlining Achieved:**
- **Before:** FOUNDATION + Template Structure + Template Foundation (redundant)
- **After:** FOUNDATION + Template Customization (streamlined)
- **Benefit:** Clear, non-redundant guidance that eliminates user confusion

**Current Session Question Count:** 10
