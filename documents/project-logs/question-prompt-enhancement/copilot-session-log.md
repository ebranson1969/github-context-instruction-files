## Question Prompt Enhancement Session (October 5, 2025)

### Question 1 - Session Initiation and Enhancement Request (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** User provided the complete question prompt template and requested to enhance question-prompt.md. Specific requirements:
1. Start logging for this session
2. Create a copy of the prompt question file in the logging directory
3. Create an exact copy that addresses existing conversation with only the question changed
4. Modify the prompt so that for New Sessions, it will copy the prompt from chat and create an md file in the logging directory

**Question Restatement:** User wants to enhance the question-prompt.md template to automatically handle session logging and prompt copying, improving the workflow for managing new sessions and continuing existing conversations.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Analyzed current question-prompt.md structure in .github/prompts/
- Reviewed session management protocol requirements
- Identified need for automated prompt copying and session-specific logging
- Current template has basic structure but lacks automated logging integration
- Enhancement will streamline workflow for both new sessions and continuing conversations

**Prompt Source:** .github/prompts/question-prompt.md

**Complete User Prompt from Chat:**
```markdown
# Question Prompt Template

*For detailed explanations, examples, and usage instructions, see: [Question Prompt Guide](./guides/question-prompt-guide.md)*

## Template: General Question

```markdown
## Your Question/Request
I want you to start a session to address the following question: I want to enhance question-prompt.md. For now I just 
want you to start the logging. Create a copy of this prompt question file in the logging directory as well as create an exact copy but it 
will address the existing conversation and the only thing that will change is the question.

I also want you to change the prompt so that if it is a New Session you will copy the prompt I put in the chat and create a md file and put it with the logging directory.
s well as create an exact copy but it
will address the existing conversation and the only thing that will change is the question.

**CRITICAL**: This session must be properly logged according to established protocols. Document all research, reasoning, and file modifications throughout this process.

## Question 2 - Session Start/Restart Protocol Enhancement (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** User requested to add a new section under the Session Logging Protocol in prompt templates to indicate whether a session is a START or RESTART, defaulting to START.

**Question Context:** The user identified that the current Session Logging Protocol section lacks explicit indication of whether a session is starting fresh or restarting from a previous state. This enhancement will improve session management clarity.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Analyzed existing Session Logging Protocol structure in workflows-prompt.md
- Identified that current protocol only asks whether to log but doesn't distinguish session type
- Enhancement needed to explicitly track START vs RESTART sessions
- Default should be START for new sessions
- RESTART option needed with note about context and log preservation

**Actions Taken:**
1. Updated `.github/prompts/workflows-prompt.md` to add new section under Session Logging Protocol
2. Added "Session Start or Restart" subsection with:
   - Clear START/RESTART options
   - Default selection set to START
   - Note about context preservation for RESTART sessions
3. Searched for other prompt files needing similar updates
4. Confirmed workflows-prompt.md was the only file with Session Logging Protocol section requiring update

**Files Modified:**
- `.github/prompts/workflows-prompt.md` - Added Session Start or Restart section

**Prompt Source:** Continuing conversation from existing session

**Complete Enhancement Added:**
```markdown
### Session Start or Restart
**Is this session a START or RESTART?**

**Default: START** ✅
- [x] START - This is a new session
- [ ] RESTART - This is a restarted session (context and logs must be preserved)
```

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - Session Start/Restart protocol successfully added to prompt template

**Search Results:** Confirmed that workflows-prompt.md was the only prompt template file containing the Session Logging Protocol section. No other prompt files require this update.

### Question 3 - Session Management Protocol Standardization (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** User identified that both "Session Logging Protocol" and "Session Management Requirements" sections existed across prompt files and requested standardization to use "Session Management Protocol" as the established protocol name from the core protocol file.

**Question Context:** The user recognized inconsistency in section naming across prompt templates and requested that all session-related protocol sections be standardized to match the official "Session Management Protocol" name from the core protocol documentation.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Reviewed the official Session Management Protocol in .github/instructions/core-protocols/session-management-protocol.md
- Identified that "Session Management Protocol" is the established, official protocol name
- Found inconsistent usage of "Session Logging Protocol" and "Session Management Requirements" across prompt files
- Standardization needed to maintain consistency and align with core protocol documentation
- All session management sections should reference the same established protocol

**Actions Taken:**
1. Searched through all prompt files in .github/prompts directory for session management sections
2. Found 4 files with session management sections requiring standardization:
   - workflows-prompt.md: "Session Logging Protocol" → "Session Management Protocol"
   - prompt-creation-prompt.md: "Session Logging Protocol" → "Session Management Protocol" 
   - master-prompt-template.md: "Session Management Requirements" → "Session Management Protocol"
   - rules-prompt.md: "Session Management Requirements" → "Session Management Protocol"
3. Updated all section headers to use "## Session Management Protocol"
4. Updated all section text to reference "established session management protocols"
5. Ensured all files include the "Session Start or Restart" subsection with START/RESTART options
6. Verified question-prompt.md and project.prompt.md correctly have no session management sections

**Files Modified:**
- `.github/prompts/workflows-prompt.md` - Standardized to Session Management Protocol
- `.github/prompts/prompt-creation-prompt.md` - Standardized to Session Management Protocol
- `.github/prompts/master-prompt-template.md` - Standardized to Session Management Protocol  
- `.github/prompts/rules-prompt.md` - Standardized to Session Management Protocol

**Standardized Section Format Applied:**
```markdown
## Session Management Protocol
**Should this [ACTION] follow the established Session Management Protocol?**

**Default: YES** ✅
- [x] YES - Follow complete Session Management Protocol as defined in [Session Management Protocol](../instructions/core-protocols/session-management-protocol.md)
- [ ] NO - Skip session management requirements for this question

*Note: Session Management Protocol includes logging, context preservation, and degradation prevention requirements.*

### Session Start or Restart
**Is this session a START or RESTART?**

**Default: START** ✅
- [x] START - This is a new session
- [ ] RESTART - This is a restarted session (context and logs must be preserved)
```

**Prompt Source:** Continuing conversation from existing session

**Status:** ✅ COMPLETED - All prompt templates now consistently use "Session Management Protocol" as the standardized section name, aligning with the established core protocol documentation.
