## Question Prompt Enhancement Session (October 5, 2025)

### Question 1 - Session Initiation and Enhancement Request (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** User provided the complete question prompt template and requested to enhance question-prompt.md. Specific requirements:
1. Start logging for this session
2. Create a copy of the prompt question file in the logging directory
3. Create an exact copy that addresses existing conversation with only the question changed
4. Modify the prompt so that for New Sessions, it will copy the prompt from chat and create an md file in the logging directory

**Question Restatement:** User wants to enhance the question-prompt.md template to automatically handle session logging and prompt copying, improving the workflow for managing new sessions and continuing existing conversations.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Analyzed current question-prompt.md structure in .github/prompts/
- Reviewed session management protocol requirements
- Identified need for automated prompt copying and session-specific logging
- Current template has basic structure but lacks automated logging integration
- Enhancement will streamline workflow for both new sessions and continuing conversations

**Prompt Source:** .github/prompts/question-prompt.md

**Complete User Prompt from Chat:**
```markdown
# Question Prompt Template

*For detailed explanations, examples, and usage instructions, see: [Question Prompt Guide](./guides/question-prompt-guide.md)*

## Template: General Question

```markdown
## Your Question/Request
I want you to start a session to address the following question: I want to enhance question-prompt.md. For now I just 
want you to start the logging. Create a copy of this prompt question file in the logging directory as well as create an exact copy but it 
will address the existing conversation and the only thing that will change is the question.

I also want you to change the prompt so that if it is a New Session you will copy the prompt I put in the chat and create a md file and put it with the logging directory.
s well as create an exact copy but it
will address the existing conversation and the only thing that will change is the question.

**CRITICAL**: This session must be properly logged according to established protocols. Document all research, reasoning, and file modifications throughout this process.
