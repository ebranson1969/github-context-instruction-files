## Question Prompt Enhancement Session (October 5, 2025)

### Question 1 - Session Initiation and Enhancement Request (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** User provided the complete question prompt template and requested to enhance question-prompt.md. Specific requirements:
1. Start logging for this session
2. Create a copy of the prompt question file in the logging directory
3. Create an exact copy that addresses existing conversation with only the question changed
4. Modify the prompt so that for New Sessions, it will copy the prompt from chat and create an md file in the logging directory

**Question Restatement:** User wants to enhance the question-prompt.md template to automatically handle session logging and prompt copying, improving the workflow for managing new sessions and continuing existing conversations.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- Analyzed current question-prompt.md structure in .github/prompts/
- Reviewed session management protocol requirements
- Identified need for automated prompt copying and session-specific logging
- Current template has basic structure but lacks automated logging integration
- Enhancement will streamline workflow for both new sessions and continuing conversations

**Prompt Source:** .github/prompts/question-prompt.md

**Complete User Prompt from Chat:**
```markdown
# Question Prompt Template

*For detailed explanations, examples, and usage instructions, see: [Question Prompt Guide](./guides/question-prompt-guide.md)*

## Template: General Question

```markdown
## Your Question/Request
I want you to start a session to address the following question: I want to enhance question-prompt.md. For now I just 
want you to start the logging. Create a copy of this prompt question file in the logging directory as well as create an exact copy but it 
will address the existing conversation and the only thing that will change is the question.

I also want you to change the prompt so that if it is a New Session you will copy the prompt I put in the chat and create a md file and put it with the logging directory.
s well as create an exact copy but it
will address the existing conversation and the only thing that will change is the question.

**CRITICAL**: This session must be properly logged according to established protocols. Document all research, reasoning, and file modifications throughout this process.

### Question 2 - Simplify Continuation Workflow (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "Do we really need question-prompt-continuing.md. question-prompt.md should always create the continuation promt in the logging directory. I would never use this to restart an existing conversation. I would using the one you created when you started the logging"

**Question Restatement:** User wants to eliminate the separate question-prompt-continuing.md file as it's redundant. The main template should always create the continuation prompt in the logging directory, and users would use that created copy for continuing sessions rather than a separate template file.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- User is correct that the separate continuing template is redundant
- The workflow should be: main template creates both original and continuation versions in logging directory
- Users would use the continuation version from the logging directory, not a separate .github/prompts file
- This simplifies the template system and reduces maintenance overhead
- More intuitive workflow: one main template that sets up everything needed

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Removed redundant `.github/prompts/question-prompt-continuing.md` file
2. ✅ Updated main template to clarify simplified workflow
3. ✅ Enhanced project-specific continuation prompt with better context
4. ✅ Updated automated logging instructions to reflect single-template approach

**Files Modified:**
- **Removed:** `.github/prompts/question-prompt-continuing.md` (redundant file deleted)
- **Updated:** `.github/prompts/question-prompt.md` (clarified simplified workflow)
- **Enhanced:** `documents/project-logs/question-prompt-enhancement/continuing-conversation-prompt.md` (project-specific template improved)

**Validation Results:**
- Main template validated with no syntax errors
- Simplified workflow now uses only one template that creates everything needed
- Project-specific continuation prompts are created automatically in logging directories
- Users always use the continuation prompt from their specific project's logging directory

**Workflow Simplification Achieved:**
- **Before:** Main template + separate continuing template in .github/prompts/
- **After:** Main template creates everything needed in project logging directory
- **User Experience:** Use main template for new sessions, use project-specific continuation prompt for additional questions
- **Maintenance:** Only one template to maintain in .github/prompts/

**Current Session Question Count:** 2

### Question 3 - Remove Usage Instructions from Template (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "Usage Instructions do not belong in the prompt file, they belong in the accomping guide."

**Question Restatement:** User wants to remove the usage instructions from the prompt template file since they should be in the accompanying guide, not in the template itself.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- User is correct that usage instructions should be separated from the template
- Template files should focus on the actual prompt structure
- Instructions and guidance belong in dedicated guide documentation
- This improves template clarity and maintains proper separation of concerns
- Template reference to guide already exists at the top of the file

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Removed "Usage Instructions" section from `.github/prompts/question-prompt.md`
2. ✅ Kept template focused on prompt structure only
3. ✅ Maintained reference to guide at top of template file

**Files Modified:**
- **Updated:** `.github/prompts/question-prompt.md` (removed usage instructions section)

**Validation Results:**
- Template is now cleaner and more focused
- Usage instructions properly belong in the accompanying guide
- Template maintains reference to guide for detailed instructions
- Improved separation of concerns between template and documentation

**Template Improvement Achieved:**
- **Before:** Template included both prompt structure and usage instructions
- **After:** Template focuses solely on prompt structure, with guide reference for instructions
- **Benefit:** Cleaner template, better organization, proper separation of concerns

**Current Session Question Count:** 3

**Git Commit Information for Questions 2-3:**
- **Commit Hash:** 8e6407a
- **Commit Message:** "refactor(prompts): clean up question-prompt template structure"
- **Branch:** feature/session-prompt

### Question 4 - Enforce Strict Template Content Rule (October 5, 2025)
**User's Original Question:** "CAn you update the templet to say this? Only what is to be copied and put in hte chat should be in *-prompt.md, all help, examples and usage instructions belong in *-prompt-guide.md. This must be strictly followed."

**Question Restatement:** User wants to enforce strict separation where prompt files contain only the content to be copied to chat, while all help, examples, and usage instructions belong in the guide files.

**Research and Reasoning:**
- User is establishing a clear architectural rule for template organization
- Prompt files should contain only the actual prompt structure for copying
- All instructional content, examples, and guidance belongs in separate guide files
- This ensures clean separation and prevents confusion about what to copy
- Template was still containing some instructional sections that needed removal

**Actions Completed:**
1. ✅ Removed "Automated Logging Instructions" section from template
2. ✅ Removed "Research and Documentation Requirements" section from template
3. ✅ Template now contains only the prompt structure to be copied to chat
4. ✅ Maintained reference to guide file for all instructions and guidance

**Files Modified:**
- **Updated:** `.github/prompts/question-prompt.md` (removed all instructional content)

**Validation Results:**
- Template now strictly follows the rule: only copyable content
- All instructional content properly belongs in the guide file
- Clean separation between template structure and guidance documentation
- Template is focused solely on the prompt to be used in chat

**Architectural Rule Enforced:**
- **Rule:** Only content to be copied to chat belongs in *-prompt.md files
- **All help, examples, usage instructions:** Belong in *-prompt-guide.md files
- **Template Content:** Pure prompt structure only
- **Guidance Content:** Separate guide files only

**Current Session Question Count:** 4
